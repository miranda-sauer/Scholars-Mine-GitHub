Anytime a file is opened, add a try and catch statement. If the file cannot be found, add a pop-up stating that the file did not exist.

Finish error tab, have it update for each run of a program what error have occured. (maybe use a pop up warning instead?)

	Nancy's Message: We used to have a list of conferences. 
	I've copied it over to the Authority Control/Lookups 
	spreadsheet (in References in Teams). Of course, the 
	dates and locations change each year for the conferences 
	that have an annual meeting. Many times several faculty 
	present at these conferences, often more than once. It 
	might be worth looking into the conferences that are 
	attended. I can export a list from Scholars' Mine. This 
	could also be used to autofill publisher and rights.
